This is a simple **registration form** built with HTML and CSS.  
It includes the following fields:
- Name
- Username
- Email
- Phone Number
- Password
- Confirm Password

## Features

✅ User-friendly layout with clear labels above each input field.  
✅ Responsive input fields with equal width and spacing.  
✅ Basic client-side validation using HTML5 attributes (`required`, `type`, `pattern`, etc.).  
✅ Real-time input feedback: input fields highlight in **red** if the entered data is invalid, and in **green** if valid.  
✅ Simple, clean and modern design that can be easily customized.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Fill out the form fields with valid information.
3. Try submitting the form with missing or incorrect data to see the validation in action.
4. Customize the styling by editing `style.css` as needed.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for the form structure and validation attributes.
- **CSS3** for styling and visual feedback for valid/invalid inputs.
